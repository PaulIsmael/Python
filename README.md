# Project Summary

Welcome to my data analysis project! In this repository, I have used the "mpg" dataset and Python Pandas to conduct a thorough analysis. This project is aimed at extracting valuable insights and trends from the dataset.

## About the "mpg" Dataset

The "mpg" dataset, also known as the "Auto MPG" dataset, is a popular dataset in data analysis. It contains information about various car models, including details such as miles per gallon (mpg), cylinders, horsepower, and more. It's widely used for exploring relationships between different car attributes and fuel efficiency.

## Key Details

- **Dataset:** [mpg dataset](link_to_mpg_dataset)
- **Analysis Tool:** Python Pandas
- **Analysis Focus:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization
